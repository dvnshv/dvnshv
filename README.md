## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This repository shall be a basic design of a computer as executed with Logisim, which is a free digital logic simulation software. This demonstrates computer architectural principles like ALU, Control Unit, Registers, Memory Units, and the Data Bus design and their functionality.

It is simple in design and yet sustains the most fundamental concepts in computer engineering and stands as a good reference for those students, their instructors, and students who study computer architecture and digital logic. Every module is well-crafted and tested to blend with the system without disruption.

Explore the repository to find Logisim circuit files, descriptions of the parts, and instructions on how to run and experiment with the design. This is a practical resource that helps understand the working of a basic computer, which can serve as a good foundation for exploring more advanced architectural explorations.
